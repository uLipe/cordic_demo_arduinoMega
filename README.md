# Cordic demonstration on Arduino:
Demo application with cordic trigonometric algorithm for embarcados
a fast and small footprint solution to compute basic trigonometric
functions for use in projects such waveform generators.

# Get started:
- Just clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/uLipe/cordic_demo_arduinoMega.git
```
- Place the folder inside of your Arduino folder;
- On the Arduino IDE just open cordic_demo.ino;
- Compile and flash on your arduino board and view the waveforms on serial plotter.
